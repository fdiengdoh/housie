# Play Housie Game

This webapp will replace the physical board and balls, so you can just have physical tickets.

A random number between 1-90 is generated (using Math.random() inbuild function of javascript) and saved on the board.

This app is purely made using html and JavaScript with Bootstrap for styling. We use js-cookie library to save the game progress.
